# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive testing coverage for the competitive shooting match result management system. The testing strategy will cover both backend API endpoints and frontend React components, ensuring reliability, maintainability, and quality assurance across the full stack application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive backend API testing, so that I can ensure all endpoints work correctly and handle edge cases properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite runs THEN the system SHALL test all authentication endpoints (register, login)
2. WHEN the test suite runs THEN the system SHALL test all CRUD operations for users, ranges, and matches
3. WHEN testing authentication THEN the system SHALL verify JWT token generation and validation
4. WHEN testing database operations THEN the system SHALL use an in-memory or test database
5. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the system SHALL verify proper error responses and status codes
6. WHEN testing middleware THEN the system SHALL verify authentication and authorization logic

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive frontend component testing, so that I can ensure UI components render correctly and handle user interactions properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite runs THEN the system SHALL test all React components for proper rendering
2. WHEN testing user interactions THEN the system SHALL simulate clicks, form submissions, and navigation
3. WHEN testing authentication flows THEN the system SHALL verify login/logout functionality
4. WHEN testing API integration THEN the system SHALL mock API calls and test error handling
5. WHEN testing routing THEN the system SHALL verify protected routes and navigation
6. WHEN testing forms THEN the system SHALL validate input handling and submission

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests, so that I can ensure the frontend and backend work together correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running integration tests THEN the system SHALL test complete user workflows
2. WHEN testing file uploads THEN the system SHALL verify end-to-end PractiScore file processing
3. WHEN testing authentication flows THEN the system SHALL verify token-based authentication across frontend and backend
4. WHEN testing data persistence THEN the system SHALL verify data is correctly stored and retrieved

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test automation and CI/CD integration, so that tests run automatically and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL automatically run all tests
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and notify developers
3. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL generate coverage reports
4. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback on failures and successes
