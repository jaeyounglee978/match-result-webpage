# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline that automatically runs on pull requests to ensure code quality by enforcing a minimum test coverage threshold of 75%. The pipeline will run tests for both frontend and backend components, generate coverage reports, and block PR merges if coverage falls below the required threshold.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated test coverage checks on pull requests, so that code quality standards are maintained before merging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request is created THEN the system SHALL trigger a GitHub Actions workflow
2. WHEN the workflow runs THEN the system SHALL execute all test suites for both frontend and backend
3. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate coverage reports for both components
4. WHEN coverage is calculated THEN the system SHALL fail the check IF overall coverage is below 75%
5. WHEN coverage meets the threshold THEN the system SHALL mark the check as passed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want detailed coverage reporting in PR comments, so that I can see exactly which areas need more testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN coverage analysis completes THEN the system SHALL post a comment on the PR with coverage details
2. WHEN coverage is below threshold THEN the comment SHALL highlight which files or components are under-covered
3. WHEN coverage improves from previous runs THEN the comment SHALL show the improvement
4. WHEN multiple commits are pushed to the same PR THEN the system SHALL update the existing comment rather than creating new ones

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the pipeline to be efficient and provide quick feedback, so that development workflow is not significantly slowed down.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the pipeline runs THEN the system SHALL use caching for node_modules to reduce build time
2. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL run frontend and backend tests in parallel where possible
3. WHEN the pipeline completes THEN the system SHALL provide clear status indicators in the PR interface
4. WHEN the pipeline fails THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages and logs

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want branch protection rules that prevent merging without adequate test coverage, so that main branch quality is guaranteed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN branch protection is configured THEN the system SHALL require the coverage check to pass before allowing merge
2. WHEN coverage check fails THEN the system SHALL prevent merge even for repository administrators
3. WHEN emergency fixes are needed THEN the system SHALL allow temporary bypass through specific workflow dispatch
4. WHEN the main branch is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain the same coverage standards

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want coverage reports to be stored and accessible, so that I can track coverage trends over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN coverage reports are generated THEN the system SHALL upload them as workflow artifacts
2. WHEN artifacts are created THEN the system SHALL retain them for at least 30 days
3. WHEN coverage data is available THEN the system SHALL support downloading detailed HTML reports
4. WHEN comparing coverage THEN the system SHALL show coverage changes compared to the target branch
